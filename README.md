# usefulcode

Over the years, I have picked up snippets of code which took me a long time to assemble. Things that should have worked out-of-the-box, somehow took me hours, because either some information was not updated or some developer had not paid enough attention to documentation.

After reviewing the learnings of endless frustrating hours on weekends and after-office, not to speak on infinite runs to Stack Overflow, and a thousand open tabs at any one time, I decided the best way to give back to the community was to put up these snipets as plug-n-play modules.

I hope some of this stuff will be useful to you.
